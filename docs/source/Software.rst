Software
========

**1. Avoid much customization**
  
Do customize if a case satisfies at least one of the following cases. 

1. When the default command does not intuitive at all.
2. The usage is high, but the current command is too complex

If not, keep the default state. Because You will forget all of your customizations after 10 years.


**2. Learning & Implementation order**

- First, Work in a light tool, library to focus on core.
- And then, Merge each works
- Finally, Apply the works to a high level

For example, if you want to implement some partial GUI features, Don't initialize a heavy framework.
Do Implement it in a light library instead.


**3. Technic < Basic**

Sometimes, You may want to look cool to others. Or you may desire to accomplish a difficult task. 

But, remember the priority
Technic < Basic
Complex < Various


**The level of concentration**

1. glance at
2. dive into
3. dig into

You must go to the 'dig into' level in order to create something.
